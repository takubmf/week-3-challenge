# week-3-challenge (Password Generator)

## Installation
    git pull from repository. 


## Description

 This week's challenge was to make a random password generator. Script2.js is, is my original work before working with a tutor, in which I learned that I overcomplicate things in my head and should try to look at it with a more pragmatic view. I also learned that you can put an if statement ona single line if it has a single lin e of execution. One of the main differeneces between pre and post tutor work is, I tried to use arrays, while my tutor told me to use a series of strings for simplicities sake. Other than most of the pieces in both files are about the same except one is finished and the other isn't.

 ## Usage
    A use case for this program would be if you want unique password for every site that you log into.
